# Hello! My name is Arek Ouzounian.
I'm a CSCI major at USC, pursuing a minor in Applied Computer Security.
You can check out [my website](https://www.arekouzounian.com) to learn more about me, or to see (probably) hacky javascript. 
<!---
Either way, you'll be disappointed.

6/22/23 - commenting this stuff out because my github grade dropped tremendously; not sure how they're calculating commits but I should have far more than whatever it's showing
